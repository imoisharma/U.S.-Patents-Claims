# U.S.-Patents-Claims
I am using USPTO ( United States Patent and Trademark Office) SOURCE LINK WHICH is the federal agency for granting U.S. patents and registering trademarks. They also provide open data about U.S. patents. So, today we will work with one open dataset they provided on their website. (Source- download the dataset from here-Patent grant full-text data/XML) Dataset Description - Patent grant full-text data (no images) (JAN 1976 - present) (1976–2001 Automated Patent System (APS) format is Green Book) Contains the full text of each patent grant issued weekly (Tuesdays) from January 1, 1976, to present (excludes images/drawings and reexaminations). The dataset contains (JAN 2002 - present) the full text of each patent grant issued weekly (Tuesdays) (excludes images/drawings and reexaminations). The file format is eXtensible Markup Language (XML) in accordance with the Patent Grant International Common Element (ICE) Document Type Definition (DTD).
